# WarpSpeed
**WarpSpeed: Night Audit Accelerator** - A tool made with the intention of streamlining the renaming of a large amount of sequentially-named .pdf files based on their contents.

**WarpSpeed** is a simple, efficient script that assists greatly in the streamlining of the Night Audit process in a hotel by removing the need to open and rename all the reports generated by certain PMS systems. Currently, it only works with reports generated in one particular hotel.

**WarpSpeed** makes use of Xpdf, specifically its tools pdftotext.exe and pdfinfo.exe which have been included here in full compliance with their redistribution terms.

## Using WarpSpeed
_(Before Running: Delete OutputFolder if it exists in WarpSpeed's root directory. Then, copy and paste all 98 Night Audit reports into WarpSpeed's root directory)_

**WarpSpeed** will prompt the user to input the date for which the Night Audit is being ran, the format for which is suggested to be MM.DD.YY but the script will allow you to choose whichever date format works best for you.

When executing, the console output will display any pertinent notifications and will eventually prompt the user if they would like to create the Audit Pack once all .pdf files have been identified and renamed.

Regardless of user choice, WarpSpeed will then generate a small report summarizing useful information retrieved from the .pdf files as needed for Night Audit
