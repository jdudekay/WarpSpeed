 
# Welcome to WarpSpeed!
**WarpSpeed** was created with the intention of streamlining the Night Audit process to help make smooth nights even smoother. Using it is designed to be as simple as possible, and really only requires a few easy steps:
## Step One
Make sure the **WarpSpeed** folder is empty and ready for processing except for:

WarpSpeed.bat

README.md

LICENSE

/xpdfTools/
 
If there is ANYTHING other than the above listed files/folders in the **WarpSpeed** folder on the Desktop, delete them so that the folder matches as it is shown above

## Step Two
Copy all .pdf Reports to **WarpSpeed** folder:
 
There should be 98 reports in total and make sure to copy ALL of them. They will all be in the p2 eci folder once the Run Audit button has been clicked. (I find it easiest to select all of the reports if you have them grouped by date)
 
## Step Three
Run **WarpSpeed**
 
The next step once youâ€™ve gotten the folder ready for processing and have copied over all 98 reports is to go ahead and run **WarpSpeed**, at the Title Screen it will ask you to press any key to continue and then will prompt you for the date that you are doing Night Audit for. Please enter this in a MM.DD.YYYY format and hit enter
 
**WarpSpeed** is designed to run more or less automatically and will run through its entire process and generate its own report as well. On its final report screen it will tell you where the audit pack has been placed, as well as all the renamed reports, and the **WarpSpeed** report itself which contains additional information for the Night Audit.

## Step Four
Copy reports to Night Audit folder

As shown in the **WarpSpeed** report screen, the processed files will be placed in a folder called OutputFolder within the **WarpSpeed** folder and the actual Audit Pack will be placed in a folder called AuditPack within the OutputFolder folder. The only additional reports that need to be run for the Audit Pack will be the Occupational Forecast reports that have to be run manually.

## Step Five
Retrieve Information from the **WarpSpeed** Report
 
The generated report within the **WarpSpeed** folder, WS_Report will currently contain the following data:
Bank Balance Sheet Totals
Ops Report Statistics
There are currently plans to expand this to include information for the M3 report as well, this guide will be updated to reflect that when it does.
