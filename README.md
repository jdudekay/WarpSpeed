# WarpSpeed
**WarpSpeed: Night Audit Accelerator** - A tool made with the intention of streamlining the renaming of a large amount of randomly-named .pdf files based on their contents.

**WarpSpeed** is a simple, efficient script that assists greatly in the streamlining of the Night Audit process in a hotel by removing the need to open and rename all the reports generated by certain PMS systems. Currently, it only works with reports generated in one particular hotel.

# Using WarpSpeed
**WarpSpeed** will prompt the user to input the date for which the Night Audit is being ran, the format for which is suggested to be MM.DD.YY but the script will allow you to choose whichever date format works best for you

During the running process, the console window will describe what is happening, with any Errors that are corrected indicated in the console output.

At the end of the process, the console window will display a short summary report of the actions taken.
