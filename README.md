# WarpSpeed
**WarpSpeed: Night Audit Accelerator** - A tool made with the intention of streamlining the renaming of a large amount of randomly-named .pdf files based on their contents.


**WarpSpeed** is a simple, efficient script that assists greatly in the streamlining of the Night Audit process in a hotel by removing the need to open and rename all the reports generated by certain PMS systems. Currently, it only works with reports generated in one particular hotel.

However, the script does allow for some user input. The script will prompt the user input the date for which the audit is being ran, which will then be appended to the end of the generated names for the files.
