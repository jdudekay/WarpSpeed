# Welcome to WarpSpeed!
 
**WarpSpeed** was created with the intention of streamlining the Night Audit process by means of automatically identifying and sorting all 98 Night Audit reports and extracting key information to be compiled in a convenient **WarpSpeed** report. 

Using **WarpSpeed** is designed to be as simple as possible, and only requires a few easy steps:

## Step One
### Prep **WarpSpeed** folder

Make sure the **WarpSpeed** folder is empty except for the following files:
* WarpSpeed.bat
* README.md
* LICENSE
* /xpdfTools/
 
If there is ANYTHING other than the above listed files/folders in the **WarpSpeed** folder on the Desktop, delete them so that the folder contents match the above

## Step Two
### Copy all .pdf Reports to **WarpSpeed** folder
 
There should be 98 reports in total and make sure to copy ALL of them. They will all be in the p2 eci folder once the Run Audit button has been clicked. (I find it easiest to select all of the reports if you have them grouped by date)
 
## Step Three
### Run **WarpSpeed**
 
The next step once youâ€™ve gotten the folder ready for processing and have copied over all 98 reports is to go ahead and run **WarpSpeed**, at the Title Screen it will ask you to press any key to continue and then will prompt you for the date which you are doing Night Audit for. Please enter this in a MM.DD.YYYY format and hit enter
 
**WarpSpeed** will run automatically through all of its functions, ending with generating a report. The Audit Pack and WS_Report's locations will be displayed on the Operation Complete screen, and the **WarpSpeed** report itself which contains additional information for the Night Audit will be displayed as the program closes.

## Step Four
### Copy reports to Night Audit folder

As shown in the **WarpSpeed** report screen, the processed files will be placed in a folder called OutputFolder within the **WarpSpeed** folder and the actual Audit Pack will be placed in a folder called AuditPack within the OutputFolder folder. The only additional reports that need to be run for the Audit Pack will be the Occupational Forecast reports which need to be run manually.

## Step Five
### Retrieve Information from the **WarpSpeed** Report
 
The generated report within the **WarpSpeed** folder, WS_Report.txt will currently contain the following data:

- Bank Balance Sheet Totals
- Ops Report Statistics
- Hotel Effectiveness Night Audit Entry Statistics

As it currently stands there are no further statistics which **WarpSpeed** can reliably extract.
